# Module-05-Challenge

## Description

For this assignment I was tasked with making a simple work day scheduler. I created a schedule that runs from 9amâ€“5pm. The hour by hour text fields are color coded to past (grey), present (red), and future (green). These fields automatically change formatting according to the current time of day. There is also a date at the top of the page that automatically lists the day of the week and current date. 

When the user clicks on the hour by hour text fields then they can enter in text. When the user clicks the save icon on the right they can save the data input into the text field into local storage. This allows the text inputs to stay on the scheduler after a page reload.
